        <p>Hi! I'm Timmy Siauw (rhymes with "<i>meow</i>"). I've been in Berkeley, CA since 2002, and I received my Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in 2012. My graduate research focused on a cancer therapy called "<i><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy">brachytherapy</a></i>", which delivers radioactive pellets directly to a tumor site. I developed algorithms that figure out where these pellets should go so the patient gets treated without hurting them.</p>

        <p>My engineering philosophy is to find real-world problems, represent them using mathematical models that have interesting algorithmic properties (such as <a>linear programs</a>), and use those models to inform decision making and improve system performance. Currently, I am appyling this philosphy in the context of data science and visualization through web applications. </p>

        <!--<p>Personally, I believe in adding value to the world and exploring possibilities enabled by new information. In the series finale of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the omnipotent Q puts it beautifully,</p>

        <p style = "padding: 0% 15% 0% 15%; text-align: justify; color: #FBD03F">"We wanted to see if you had the ability to expand your mind and your horizons. ... For that one fraction of a second, you were open to options you had never considered. That is the exploration that awaits you. Not mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknown possibilities of existence."</p> -->

        <p>When I'm not hacking a project, I enjoy bouldering, pursuing overall health and fitness, reading/listening to science fiction and fantasy books/audiobooks, playing <a>Go</a>, and going to the movie theater.</p>

        <p>Please enjoy the rest my site!</p>
