                I helped develop a Philips prototype system for prostate, permanent-seed implant brachytherapy. The system incorporated real-time ultrasound, deformable image registration algorithms and an electromagnetic needle tracking system. I performed benchmark testing for the system in gelatin phantoms and gave feedback on the user interface design. 

                I also developed and tested an end-to-end workflow for building custom brachytherapy applicators. This worked required combining patient scans and user input into a 3D model of an applicator, sourcing the 3D printing, validating the printed applicator, cleaning it, and streamlining the workflow to be clinically viable.

                I recruited and mentored several undergraduate student researchers from UC Berkeley, including two that published journal articles (see Nattagh et al, 2013 and Cunha et al, 2015).</td>

I designed the linear and integer programming models, analyzed their properties when appropriate, and tested them on data taken from patients previously treated at UCSF. To support this work, I also developed a Matlab toolbox for loading patient data sets, inputting parameters, and testing new planning algorithms on batches of data. In one study, I integrated these planning algorithms on the Acubot-RND, a needle insertion robot developed at Johns Hopkins University, to determine the feasibility of automating the needle insertion process of brachytherapy. This study won the Best Application Paper Award at the Conference for Automation Science and Engineering in 2012. </td>
